The Montpelier Foundation is the home of James Madison, the 4th President of the United States and Father of the Constitution, and is located in Orange, Virginia. It has an active historical and public archaeology program that conducts excavations at Montpelier for 9 months out of the year, Madison's original home, primarily focused on the lives of the enslaved individuals who lived on the property. These excavations are conducted by the Montpelier Archaeology Department, which runs week long excavation programs for the public and month long archaeology field schools for archaeology students. 

Excavations generate thousands of artifacts, each of which is washed, sorted, identified, and catalogued onto hundreds of catalogue sheets. This crowdsourcing project is designed to help the archaeology department data-enter these catalogue sheets so they can be used for ongoing analysis of the excavated sites. This project will allow you, the public, to participate in this stage of artifact analysis. The sheets in this particular project are the faunal remains excavated during the 2016 field season at the North Dwelling and South Kitchen, two structures used by Madison's slaves during the early 1800s. Your help is needed transcribing these sheets into a tabluated format. Please follow the instructions in the tutorial and contact us using the forum if you have any questions!
