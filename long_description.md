Since 1987, Montpelier (Virginia, USA) has hosted archaeology fields schools, training college students in archaeological 
methods. This crowdsourcing project allows you to participate remotely in their work. The archaeological team would like
your help to transcribe hand written faunal records into a tablulated format which can then be transformed into useful 
 digital data. This is quite a straight forward project, follow the instructions in the tutorial and if you have any 
 questions, please do get in touch via our forum.
